                W. H. Auden was admired for his unsurpassed technical 
                virtuosity and ability to write poems in nearly every 
                imaginable verse form; his incorporation of popular 
                culture, current events, and vernacular speech in his work; 
                and also for the vast range of his intellect, which drew easily 
                from an extraordinary variety of literatures, art forms, social 
                and political theories, and scientific and technical information.
